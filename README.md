# SuncorpAPI

I have used the County by Boundaries and by Country API for this test

The Collection contains the HTTP Method GET for retrieving the County by using the location co-ordinates and also by respective State

Please import the Collection and execute it using the Collection Runner

I have added assertions for Happy path scenario and also added a negative test by making it fail for status code 404 as expected result

NOTE: I have not added Newman feature for you to run it in CI/CD pipeline. If needed I can implement this and send you. In addition to this the exercise looks like manual testing as I have not written code in RestAssured or API studio for automating this as this was not mentioned in the exercise
